                     FC-BGP Protocol Specification
                draft-wang-sidrops-fcbgp-protocol-latest

Abstract

   This document defines an extension, Forwarding Commitment BGP (FC-
   BGP), to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).  FC-BGP provides security
   for the path of Autonomous Systems (ASs) through which a BGP UPDATE
   message passes.  Forwarding Commitment (FC) is a cryptographically
   signed segment to certify an AS's routing intent on its directly
   connected hops.  Based on FC, FC-BGP aims to build a secure inter-
   domain system that can simultaneously authenticate the AS_PATH
   attribute in the BGP UPDATE message and alleviate route leaks in the
   BGP routing system.  The extension is backward compatible, which
   means a router that supports the extension can interoperate with a
   router that doesn't support the extension.

1.  Introduction

   The FC-BGP mechanism described in this document aims to ensure that
   advertised routes in BGP [RFC4271] are authentic and alleviate the
   BGP route leaks.  FC-BGP accomplishes this by introducing a new
   optional, transitive, and extended length path attribute called FC
   (Forwarding Commitment) to the BGP UPDATE message.  This attribute
   can be used by an FC-BGP-compliant BGP speaker (referred to hereafter
   as an FC-BGP speaker) to generate, propagate, and validate BGP UPDATE
   messages to enhance security.  In other words, when the BGP UPDATE
   message travels through an FC-BGP-enabled AS, it adds a new FC based
   on the AS order in AS_PATH.  Subsequent ASs can then utilize the list
   of FCs in the BGP UPDATE message to ensure that the advertised path
   is consistent with the AS_PATH attribute.  And as a complementary of
   [RFC9234], it can also alleviate the BGP route leaks.

   BGPsec is a path-level authentication approach described in
   [RFC8205].  It replaces the AS_PATH attribute, which is used to
   record the sequence of autonomous systems (ASes) that a BGP update
   has traversed, with the non-transitive BGPsec_Path attribute.
   However, when a peer does not support BGPsec, the BGPsec_Path
   attribute will be downgraded to the standard AS_PATH attribute,
   losing the security benefits BGPsec provides.  In contrast, FC-BGP
   (Forwarding Commitment BGP) preserves the AS_PATH attribute and
   introduces an additional list of signed messages called Forwarding
   Commitments.  Each Forwarding Commitment (FC) is a publicly
   verifiable code certifying the correctness of a three-hop pathlet.
   FC-BGP builds its path authentication based on these FCs.

   FC-BGP and BGPsec offer different levels of security benefits in the
   case of partial deployment, even though they achieve the same
   security benefits when fully deployed.  BGPsec tightly couples path
   authentication with the BGP path construction process, requiring each
   AS to iteratively verify the signatures of each prior hop before
   extending the authentication chain.  Consequently, a single legacy AS
   that does not support BGPsec can break the authentication chain,
   preventing subsequent BGPsec-aware ASes from reviving the
   authentication process.  As a result, in partial deployment
   scenarios, BGPsec is often downgraded to the legacy BGP protocol,
   losing its security benefits.

   In contrast to BGPsec, FC-BGP treats partial deployability as a
   first-class citizen.  It adopts a pathlet-driven authentication
   paradigm, in which the authenticity of an AS path can be
   incrementally built based on authenticated pathlets.  This design
   ensures that downstream FC-BGP-aware ASes can use the authenticated
   pathlets provided by upstream upgraded ASes, even if the full AS path
   traverses legacy ASes that do not support FC-BGP.  By allowing the
   authentication of sub-paths, FC-BGP enables incremental deployment
   and provides security benefits to the FC-BGP-aware ASes, regardless
   of the deployment status of other ASes on the path Appendix A.1.1.1.

   Similar to BGPsec, FC-BGP relies on RPKI to perform route origin
   validation [RFC6483].  Additionally, any FC-BGP speaker that wishes
   to process the FC path attribute along with BGP UPDATE messages MUST
   obtain a router certificate and store it in the RPKI repository.
   This certificate is associated with its AS number.  The router key
   generation here follows [RFC8208] and [RFC8635].

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED that both BGPsec and FC-BGP simultaneously be
   enabled in a BGP network.  However, if a BGP update message contains
   both BGPsec and FC-BGP features, the BGP speaker should process the
   message properly.  In such cases, the BGP speaker should prioritize
   BGPsec over FC-BGP.  This means that if a BGP update message includes
   the BGPsec_PATH attribute, a BGP speaker that supports both BGPsec
   and FC-BGP should use the Secure_Path instead of the AS_PATH to
   generate or verify the FC segments.  This prioritization ensures that
   the presence of FC-BGP does not compromise the security benefits of
   BGPsec in the same update message.  More discussion is at
   Section 6.11.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Definitions, and Acronyms

   The following terms are used with a specific meaning:

   BGP neighbor:
      Also just 'neighbor'.  Two BGP speakers that communicate using the
      BGP protocols are neighbors.  It can be divided into iBGP neighbor
      and eBGP neighbor.

   BGP speaker:
      A device, usually a router, exchanging routes with other BGP
      speakers using the BGP protocol.

   BGP UPDATE:
      The message is generated with several path attributes to advertise
      routes.

   iBGP:
      iBGP neighbor, internal BGP neighbor, or internal neighbor.
      Internal neighbors are in the same AS.

   eBGP:
      eBGP neighbor, external BGP neighbor, or external neighbor.
      External neighbors are in different ASs.

   Router:
      In this document, the router always refers to a BGP speaker.

   In addition to the list above, the following terms are used in this
   document:

   FC:
      Forwarding Commitment, i.e., FC segment.  It contains several
      fields and a digital signature to protect the current path.

   FCList:
      An ordered list of FC segments to protect the whole AS-Path in the
      BGP UPDATE message.  The order of FCs follows the order of AS
      numbers in the AS-Path.  All FC-BGP-enabled BGP speakers SHOULD
      add their FCs to the BGP UPDATE message.

   FC path attribute:
      The optional, transitive, extended length path attribute is
      defined in this document to obtain BGP security.

   FC-BGP UPDATE:
      A BGP UPDATE message carries the FC path attribute.

   FC-BGP speaker:
      A BGP speaker that enables the FC-BGP feature.  It can generate,
      propagate, and validate FC-BGP UPDATE messages.

2.  FC-BGP Negotiation

   FC-BGP does not need to negotiate with neighbors since it is
   considered a transitive path attribute within the BGP UPDATE message.
   BGP speakers that do not recognize the FC path attribute or do not
   support FC-BGP, SHOULD still transmit the FC path attribute to their
   neighbors.  As a result, there is no need to establish a new BGP
   capability as defined in [RFC5492].

3.  FC Path Attribute

   Unlike BGPsec, FC-BGP does not modify the AS_PATH.  Instead, FC is
   enclosed in a BGP UPDATE message as an optional, transitive, and
   extended length path attribute.  This document registers a new
   attribute type code for this attribute: TBD, see Section 8 for more
   information.

   The FC path attribute includes the digital signatures that protect
   the pathlet information.  We refer to those update messages that
   contain the FC path attribute as "FC-BGP UPDATE messages".  Although
   FC-BGP would not modify the AS_PATH path attribute, it is REQUIRED to
   never use the AS_SET or AS_CONFED_SET in FC-BGP according to
   [RFC6472].

   The format of the FC path attribute is shown in Figure 1 and
   Figure 2.  Figure 1 shows the format of FC path attribute and
   Figure 2 shows the FC segment format.

                   Figure 1: Format of FC path attribute.

   FC path attribute includes the following parts:

   Flags (1 octet):
      The current value is 0b11010000, representing the FC path
      attribute as optional, transitive, partial, and extended-length.

   Type (1 octet):
      The current value is TBD.  Refer to Section 8 for more
      information.

   FCList Length (2 octets):
      The value is the total length of the FCList in octets.

   FCList (variable length):
      The value is a sequence of FC segments, in order.  The definition
      of the FC segment format is shown in Figure 2.  It does not
      conflict with the AS_PATH attribute.  That means the FC-BGP path
      attribute and AS_PATH attribute can coexist in the same FC-BGP
      UPDATE message.

                      Figure 2: Format of FC segment.

   In FC-BGP, all ASs MUST use 4-byte AS numbers in FC segments.
   Existing 2-byte AS numbers are converted into 4-byte AS numbers by
   setting the two high-order octets of the 4-octet field to 0
   [RFC6793].

   FC segment includes the following parts.  (See Section 4 for more
   details on populating these fields.)

   Previous Autonomous System Number (PASN, 4 octets):
      The PASN is the AS number of the previous hop AS from whom the FC-
      BGP speaker receives the FC-BGP UPDATE message.  If the current AS
      has no previous AS hop, it MUST be filled with 0.  It will be
      discussed more at Section 7.4.1.

   Current Autonomous System Number (CASN, 4 octets):
      The CASN is the AS number of the FC-BGP speaker that added this FC
      segment to the FC path attribute.

   Nexthop Autonomous System Number (NASN, 4 octets):
      The NASN is the AS number of the next hop AS to whom the FC-BGP
      speaker will send the BGP UPDATE message.

   Subject Key Identifier (SKI, 20 octets):
      The SKI in the RPKI router certificate is a unique identifier for
      the public key used for signature verification.  If the SKI length
      exceeds 20 octets, it should retrieve the leftmost 20 octets.

   Algorithm ID (1 octet):
      The current assigned value is 1, indicating that SHA256 is used to
      hash the content to be signed, and ECDSA is used for signing.  It
      follows the algorithm suite defined in [RFC8208] and its updates.
      Each FC segment has an Algorithm ID, so there is no need to worry
      about sudden changes in its algorithm suite.  The key in FC-BGP
      uses the BGPsec Router Key, so its generation and management
      follow [RFC8635].

   Flags (1 octet):
      Several flag bits.  The leftmost bit of the Flags field in
      Figure 2 is the Confed_Segment flag (Flags-CS).  The Flags-CS flag
      is set to 1 to indicate that the FC-BGP speaker that constructed
      this FC segment is sending the UPDATE message to a peer AS within
      the same AS confederation [RFC5065].  (That is, a sequence of
      consecutive Confed_Segment flags are set in an FC-BGP UPDATE
      message whenever, in a non-FC-BGP UPDATE message, an AS_PATH
      segment of type AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE occurs.)  In all other cases,
      the Flags-CS flag is set to 0.  The second leftmost bit (i.e., the
      second highest) of the Flags field in Figure 2 is the Route_Server
      flag (Flags-RS).  The Flags-RS flag is set to 1 to indicate that a
      route server adds this FC segment, but the AS number will never
      appear in the AS_PATH attribute.  If the AS number of a router
      server is inserted into AS_PATH, this Flags-RS flag MUST be set to
      0.  The third leftmost bit (i.e., the third highest) of the Flags
      field in Figure 2 is the Only_to_Customer flag (Flags-OTC).  The
      Flags-OTC flag is set to 1 to indicate that the FC segment's
      issuer AS sends routes to its customer or peer.  If this Flags-OTC
      flag is set, the next route propagation will only be permitted to
      the following customers.  The remaining 5 bits of the Flags field
      are unassigned.  They MUST be set to 0 by the sender and ignored
      by the receiver.

   Signature Length (2 octets):
      It only contains the length of the Signature field in octets, not
      including other fields.

   Signature (variable length):
      The signature content and order are Signature=ECDSA(SHA256(PASN,
      CASN, NASN, Prefix, Prefix Length)), where the Prefix is the IP
      address prefix which is encapsulated in the BGP UPDATE, i.e. NLRI,
      and only one prefix is used each time.  When hashing and signing,
      the full IP address and IP prefix length are used, i.e., IPv4 uses
      4 octets and IPv6 uses 16 octets.

4.  FC-BGP UPDATE Messages

4.1.  Generation

   This part defines the generation of the FC path attribute and the FC
   segment.  An FC-BGP speaker SHOULD generate a new FC segment or even
   a new FC path attribute when it propagates a route to its external
   neighbors.  For internal neighbors, the FC path attribute in the BGP
   UPDATE message remains unchanged.

   The FC-BGP speaker follows a specific process to create the FC path
   attribute for the ongoing UPDATE message.  Firstly, it generates a
   new FC Segment containing the necessary information for the FC path.
   This new FC Segment is then added to the FCList of the outer format
   defined in Figure 1.  It is important to note that if the FC-BGP
   speaker is not the origin AS and there is already an existing FC path
   attribute of the UPDATE message, it MUST prepend its new FC segment
   to the FCList of the existing FC path attribute like the insertion
   process of ASN in AS_PATH attribute.  This allows the FC-BGP speaker
   to contribute to its own FC segment while maintaining the existing FC
   path information.  Otherwise, if it is the source AS, the FC-BGP
   speaker generates the FC path attribute defined in Figure 1 and
   inserts it into the UPDATE message.

   There are three AS numbers in one FC segment as Figure 2 shows.  The
   populating of the Current AS number (CASN) within the FC segment is
   like the AS number in BGPsec, it MUST match the AS number in the
   Subject field of the RPKI router certificate that will be used to
   verify the FC segment constructed by this FC-BGP speaker (see
   Section 3.1.1 of [RFC8209] and [RFC6487]).  The Previous AS number
   (PASN) is typically set to the AS number from which the UPDATE
   message receives.  However, if the FC-BGP speaker is located in the
   origin AS, the PASN SHOULD be filled with 0.  The Nexthop AS number
   (NASN) is set to the AS number of the peer to whom the route is
   advertised.  So if there are several neighbors, the FC-BGP speaker
   should generate separate FCs for different neighbors.  But it would
   never generate a new FC segment for the iBGP neighbor.

   The Subject Key Identifier field (SKI) within the new FC segment is
   populated with the identifier found in the Subject Key Identifier
   extension of the RPKI router certificate associated with the FC-BGP
   speaker.  This identifier serves as a crucial piece of information
   for recipients of the route advertisement.  It enables them to
   identify the appropriate certificate to employ when verifying the
   signatures in FC segments attached to the route advertisement.  This
   practice adheres to the guidelines outlined in [RFC8209].

   Typically, the Flags field is set to 0.

   A route server (RS) is a third-party brokering system that
   interconnects three or more BGP-speaking routers using eBGP in IXPs
   [RFC7947].  Typically, RS performs like a transit AS except that it
   does not insert its AS number to the AS_PATH attribute.  The route
   server also can participate in the FC-BGP process.  If the RS is an
   FC-BGP-enabled RS, it may choose to set the Flags-RS bit to 1 when it
   populates its FC segment.  However, when the RS chooses to add its AS
   number to the AS_PATH attribute, the Flags-RS bit SHOULD be set to 0.
   If the RS is a non-FC-BGP RS, it propagates the FC-BGP UPDATE message
   directly.  Anyway, the AS number of RS would be used in the FC
   segment no matter if it appears in the AS_PATH attribute.

   Typically, the route server does not insert ASN into AS_PATH.  Take
   Figure 3 as an example where AS A advertises a BGP UPDATE to AS C and
   RS connects AS A and AS B.  When RS supports the FC-BGP mechanism, AS
   A adds its FC segment: FC(NULL, A, RS), RS adds its FC segment: FC(A,
   RS, B, Flags-RS), and AS B adds its FC segment: FC(RS, B, C).  If RS
   does not support the FC-BGP mechanism, FC(A, RS, B, Flags-RS) is
   missed in FCList, which SHOULD be considered as a partial deployment
   scenario.

   +--------+     +--------+     +--------+     +--------+

      Figure 3: A network topology with Router Server linked two ASes.

   AS Path Prepending is a traffic engineering mechanism in BGP to
   deprioritize a route or alternate path, which will prepend the local
   AS number multiple times to the AS_PATH attribute [ASPP].  To
   minimize unnecessary processing load during the validation of FC
   segments, an FC-BGP speaker SHOULD NOT generate multiple consecutive
   FC segments with the same AS number.  Instead, the FC-BGP speaker
   SHOULD aim to produce a single FC segment once, even if the intention
   is to achieve the semantics of prepending the same AS number multiple
   times.

   The Algorithm ID field is set to 1.  FC-BGP only supports one
   algorithm suite in this document as BGPsec Algorithm defined in
   [RFC8208].  That is the signature algorithm used MUST be the Elliptic
   Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with curve P-256 and the
   hash algorithm used MUST be SHA-256.  If it transits from one
   algorithm suite to another, the FC-BGP speaker MUST place its router
   certificate in the RPKI repository first and then specify the
   Algorithm ID in the FC segment.

   The Signature Length field is populated with the length (in octets)
   of the value in the Signature field.

   The Signature field in the new FC segment is a variable length field.
   It contains a digital signature encapsulated in DER format that binds
   the prefix, its length, and triplet <PASN, CASN, NASN> to the RPKI
   router certificate corresponding to the FC-BGP speaker.  The digital
   signature is computed as follows: Signature=ECDSA(SHA256(PASN, CASN,
   NASN, Prefix, Prefix Length)).

   The signatures within the FC segments of an FC-BGP UPDATE message
   ensure the protection of crucial information including the AS number
   of the neighbor involved in the message exchange.  This information
   is explicitly included in the generated FC segment.  Consequently, if
   an FC-BGP speaker intends to transmit an FC-BGP UPDATE message to
   multiple BGP neighbors, it MUST generate a distinct FC-BGP UPDATE
   message for each unique neighbor AS to whom the UPDATE message is
   being sent.

   Indeed, an FC-BGP UPDATE message is REQUIRED to advertise a route to
   just one prefix.  This is because if an FC-BGP speaker receives an
   UPDATE message containing multiple prefixes, it would be unable to
   construct a valid FC-BGP UPDATE message, including valid path
   signatures, with a subset of the received prefixes.  To advertise
   routes to multiple prefixes, the FC-BGP speaker MUST generate
   individual FC-BGP UPDATE messages for each prefix.  This ensures the
   proper construction of valid path signatures for each advertised
   prefix.

   All FC-BGP UPDATE messages MUST conform to BGP's maximum message
   size.  If the resulting message exceeds the maximum message size,
   then the guidelines in Section 9.2 of [RFC4271] MUST be followed.

4.2.  Propagation

   Any BGP speaker should propagate the optional transitive FC path
   attribute encapsulated in the FC-BGP UPDATE message, even though they
   do not support the FC-BGP feature.  However, it is important to note
   that an FC-BGP speaker SHOULD NOT make any attestation regarding the
   validation state of the FC-BGP UPDATE message it receives.  They MUST
   verify the FC path attribute themselves.

   To incorporate or create a new FC segment for an FC-BGP UPDATE
   message using a specific algorithm suite, the FC-BGP speaker MUST
   possess an appropriate private key capable of generating signatures
   for that particular algorithm suite.  Moreover, this private key MUST
   correspond to the public key found in a valid RPKI End Entity (EE)
   certificate.  The AS number resource extension within this
   certificate should include the FC-BGP speaker's AS number as
   specified in [RFC8209].  It is worth noting that these new segments
   are only prepended to an FC-BGP UPDATE message when the FC-BGP
   speaker generates the UPDATE message for transmission to an external
   neighbor.  In other words, this occurs when the AS number of the
   neighbor differs from the AS number of the FC-BGP speaker.

   The RPKI allows the legitimate holder of IP address prefix(es) to
   issue a digitally signed object known as a Route Origin Authorization
   (ROA).  This ROA authorizes a specific AS to originate routes for a
   particular set of prefixes [RFC6482].  It is anticipated that most
   Relying Parties (RPs) will combine FC-BGP with origin validation
   [RFC6483] and [RFC6811].  Therefore, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that
   an FC-BGP speaker only advertises a route for a given prefix in an
   FC-BGP UPDATE message if there is a valid ROA that authorizes the FC-
   BGP speaker's AS to originate routes for that specific prefix.

   If an FC-BGP router receives a non-FC-BGP UPDATE message from an
   external neighbor, meaning that the origin BGP speaker does not
   support FC-BGP, the router processes the UPDATE message as a regular
   BGP UPDATE message typically.  In this case, it SHOULD NOT add its
   own FC segment to the UPDATE message.  On the other hand, when the
   FC-BGP speaker advertises routes belonging to its local AS and
   receives them from an internal neighbor, it MUST add its FC segment
   to the UPDATE message if it decides to propagate those routes.
   Furthermore, if the FC-BGP router receives an FC-BGP UPDATE message
   from a neighbor for a specific prefix and chooses to propagate that
   neighbor's route for the prefix, it MUST propagate the route as an
   FC-BGP UPDATE message containing the FC path attribute.

   When an FC-BGP speaker sends an FC-BGP UPDATE message to an iBGP
   (internal BGP) neighbor, the process is straightforward.  When the
   FC-BGP speaker originates a new route advertisement and sends it to
   an iBGP neighbor, it MUST NOT include the FC path attribute of the
   UPDATE message.  In other words, the FC-BGP speaker omits the FC path
   attribute.  Similarly, when an FC-BGP speaker decides to forward an
   FC-BGP UPDATE message to an iBGP neighbor, it MUST refrain from
   adding a new FC segment to the FC-BGP UPDATE message.

   When an FC-BGP speaker receives an FC-BGP UPDATE message containing
   an FC path attribute (with one or more FC segments) from an (internal
   or external) neighbor, it may choose to propagate the route
   advertisement by sending it to its other (internal or external)
   neighbors.  When sending the route advertisement to an internal FC-
   BGP-speaking neighbor, the FC path attribute SHALL NOT be modified.
   When sending the route advertisement to an external FC-BGP-speaking
   neighbor, the following procedures are used to form or update the FC
   path attribute.

4.3.  Processing Instructions for AS Confederation Members

   Members of AS Confederation [RFC5065] MUST additionally follow the
   instructions in this section for processing FC-BGP UPDATE messages.

   When an FC-BGP speaker in an AS confederation receives an FC-BGP
   UPDATE message from a neighbor that is external to the confederation
   and chooses to propagate the UPDATE message within the confederation,
   it first adds an FC segment and the signature signed to its own
   Member-AS (i.e., the 'Current AS Number' is the FC-BGP speaker's
   Member-AS Number).  In this internally modified UPDATE message, the
   newly added FC segment contains the public AS number (i.e.,
   Confederation Identifier), and the segment's Confed_Segment flag is
   set to 1.  The newly added signature is generated using a private key
   corresponding to the public AS number of the confederation.  The FC-
   BGP speaker propagates the modified UPDATE message to its peers
   within the confederation.  (Note: In this document, intra-Member-AS
   peering is regarded as iBGP, and inter-Member-AS peering is regarded
   as eBGP.  The latter is also known as confederation-eBGP.)

   Within a confederation, the verification of FC-BGP signatures added
   by other members of the confederation is optional.  Note that if a
   confederation chooses not to verify digital signatures within the
   confederation, then FC-BGP is not able to provide any assurances
   about the integrity of the Member-AS Numbers placed in FC segments
   where the Confed_Segment flag is set to 1.

   When a confederation member receives an FC-BGP UPDATE message from a
   peer within the confederation and propagates it to a peer outside the
   confederation, it needs to remove all of the FC segments added by
   confederation members when it removes all path segments of the
   AS_PATH with the type of AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET.  To do
   this, the confederation members propagated the route outside the
   confederation the following:

   1.  Starting with the most recently added FC segment, remove FC
       segments whose Flags-CS bit is 1.  Stop this process once an FC
       segment that has its Confed_Segment flags set to 0 is reached.

   2.  Add an FC segment containing, in the CASN field, the AS
       Confederation Identifier (the public AS number of the
       confederation).  Note that all fields other than the CASN field
       are populated.

   Finally, as discussed above, an AS confederation MAY optionally
   decide that its members will not verify digital signatures added by
   members.  In such a confederation, when an FC-BGP speaker runs the
   algorithm in Section 5.2.1, the FC-BGP speaker, during the process of
   signature verifications, first checks whether the Confed_Segment flag
   in an FC segment is set to 1.  If the flag is set to 1, the FC-BGP
   speaker skips the verification for the corresponding signature and
   immediately moves on to the next FC segment.  It is an error when an
   FC-BGP speaker receives, from a neighbor who is not in the same AS
   confederation, an FC-BGP UPDATE message containing a Confed_Segment
   flag set to 1.

4.4.  Processing Instructions for BGP Route Leak Prevention

   BGP routing system suffers lots of vulnerabilities.  The systemic
   vulnerability of the BGP routing system is known as "route leaks"
   [RFC7908].  There are 6 types of route leaks defined in [RFC7908].

   [RFC9234] can detect and prevent BGP route leaks by adding a new BGP
   OPEN Role capability and OTC transitive path attribute.  However, it
   may be forged.

   When using BGP route leak prevention with FC-BGP, it SHOULD tell the
   neighbor its BGP Role as Section 4 of [RFC9234].  If the peer's role
   is Customer, Peer, or RS-Client, the Flags-OTC MUST be set to 1 on
   route advertisement.  Then, the route SHOULD subsequently go only to
   the Customers.  It is worth noting that if the recently added FC
   Segment already set the Flags-OTC flag, it MUST NOT be propagated to
   Providers, Peers, or RSes.

5.  Processing a Received FC-BGP UPDATE Message

5.1.  Overview

   When receiving an FC-BGP UPDATE message from an external BGP neighbor
   carrying the FC path attribute, an FC-BGP speaker SHOULD first
   validate the message to determine the authenticity of the path
   information.  Same as BGPsec, an FC-BGP speaker will wish to perform
   origin validation (see [RFC6483] and [RFC6811]) on an incoming FC-BGP
   UPDATE message, but such validation is independent of the validation
   described in this section.

   After the validation, the FC-BGP speaker may want to send the FC-BGP
   UPDATE message to neighbors according to local route policies.  Then
   It SHOULD update the FC path attributes and continue advertising the
   BGP route.

   For the origin AS who launches the advertisement, the FC-BGP speaker
   only needs to generate the FC-BGP UPDATE message other than the
   validation.

   The FC-BGP speaker stores the router certificates in the RPKI
   repository, and any changes in the RPKI state can impact the validity
   of the UPDATE messages.  That means the validity of FC-BGP UPDATE
   messages relies on the current state of the RPKI repository.  When an
   FC-BGP speaker becomes aware of a change in the RPKI state, such as
   through an RPKI validating cache using the RTR protocol (as specified
   in [RFC8210]), it is REQUIRED to rerun validation on all affected
   UPDATE messages stored in its Adj-RIB-In [RFC4271].  For instance, if
   a specific RPKI router certificate becomes invalid due to expiration
   or revocation, all FC-BGP UPDATE messages containing an FC segment
   with a SKI matching the SKI in the affected certificate must be
   reassessed to determine their current validity.  If the reassessment
   reveals a change in the validity state of an UPDATE message, the FC-
   BGP speaker, depending on its local policy, SHOULD need to rerun the
   best path selection process.  This allows for the appropriate
   handling of the updated information and ensures that the most valid
   and suitable paths are chosen for routing purposes.

5.2.  Validation

   When verifying the authenticity of an FC-BGP UPDATE message,
   information from the RPKI router certificates is utilized.  The RPKI
   router certificates provide the data including the triplet <AS
   Number, Public Key, Subject Key Identifier> to verify the AS_PATH and
   FC path attributes.  As a prerequisite, the recipient MUST have
   access to these RPKI router certificates.

   Note that if an AS uploads its router certificates to RPKI, it would
   be deemed to support FC-BGP.  The validation process MUST check that
   to ensure no malicious on-path AS removes FCs from FC-BGP UPDATE.

   Note that the FC-BGP speaker could perform the validation of RPKI
   router certificates on its own and extract the required data, or it
   could receive the same data from a trusted cache that performs RPKI
   validation on behalf of (some set of) FC-BGP speakers.  (For example,
   the trusted cache could deliver the necessary validity information to
   the FC-BGP speaker by using the Router Key PDU (Protocol Data Unit)
   for the RPKI-Router protocol [RFC8210].)

   The recipient validates an FC-BGP UPDATE message containing the FC
   path attribute and obtains one result of two states: 'Valid' and 'Not
   Valid'.  We will describe the validation procedure in Section 5.2.1
   in this document.  The validation result will be used at BGP route
   selection, thus it will be discussed at Section 6.4.

   As the FC-BGP UPDATE message generates at the eBGP router, the FC-BGP
   validation needs only to be performed at the eBGP router.  The iBGP
   route plays a crucial role in the FC-BGP UPDATE message propagation
   and distribution.  The function of iBGP is to convey the validation
   status of an FC-BGP UPDATE message from an ingress edge router to an
   egress edge router within an AS.  The specific mechanisms used to
   convey the validation status can vary depending on the implementation
   and local policies of the AS.  By propagating this information
   through iBGP, the eBGP router, and other routers within the AS, can
   be aware of the validation status of the FC-BGP UPDATE messages and
   make routing decisions accordingly.  As stated in Section 4, when an
   FC-BGP speaker decides to forward a syntactically correct FC-BGP
   UPDATE message, it is RECOMMENDED to do so while preserving the FC
   path attribute.  This recommendation applies regardless of the
   validation state of the UPDATE message.

   Ultimately, the decision to forward the FC-BGP UPDATE message with
   the FC path intact and the choice to perform independent validation
   at the egress router are both determined by local policies
   implemented within the AS.  Note that the decision to perform
   validation on the received FC-BGP UPDATE message is left to the
   discretion of the egress router, which is the router receiving the
   message within its own AS.  The egress router has the freedom to
   choose whether or not it wants to independently validate the FC path
   attribute based on its local policy, even if the FC path attribute
   has already been validated by the ingress router.  This additional
   validation performed at the egress router helps ensure the integrity
   and security of the received FC-BGP UPDATE message.

5.2.1.  Validation Algorithm

   This section specifies the concrete validation algorithm of FC-BGP
   UPDATE messages.  A compliant implementation MUST have an FC-BGP
   UPDATE validation algorithm that behaves the same as the specified
   algorithm.  This ensures consistency and security in validating FC-
   BGP UPDATE messages across different implementations.  It allows for
   interoperability and standardized communication between FC-BGP-
   enabled networks.

   First, the integrity of the FC-BGP UPDATE message MUST be checked.
   Both syntactical and protocol violation errors are checked.  The FC
   path attribute MUST be present when an FC-BGP UPDATE message is
   received from an external FC-BGP neighbor and also when such an
   UPDATE message is propagated to an internal FC-BGP neighbor.  The
   error checks specified in Section 6.3. of [RFC4271] are performed,
   except that for FC-BGP UPDATE messages the checks on the FC path
   attribute do not apply and instead, the following checks on the FC
   path attribute are performed:

   1.   Check to ensure that the entire FC path attribute is
        syntactically correct (conforms to the specification in this
        document).

   2.   Check that the FC path attribute contains a relative FC segment
        whose CASN field has the same value as the AS number for each AS
        on AS_PATH that has a router certificate in RPKI.

   3.   Check that the triplet <PASN, CASN, NASN> fields in each FC
        segment follow the order in AS_PATH.

   4.   Check that each FC segment contains one signature with the
        supported Algorithm ID.

   5.   If the UPDATE message was received from an FC-BGP neighbor that
        is not a member of the FC-BGP speaker's AS confederation, check
        to ensure that none of the FC Segments contain a Flags field
        with the Confed_Segment flag set to 1.

   6.   If the UPDATE message was received from an FC-BGP neighbor that
        is not a member of the FC-BGP speaker's AS confederation, check
        to ensure that the FC Segment corresponding to that peer does
        not contain a Flags field with the Flags-CS flag set to 1.

   7.   If the UPDATE message was received from an FC-BGP neighbor that
        is a member of the FC-BGP speaker's AS confederation, check to
        ensure that the FC Segment corresponding to that peer contains a
        Flags field with the Flags-CS flag set to 1.

   8.   If the UPDATE message was received from a neighbor that is not
        expected to set Flags-RS bit to 0 (see Section 4), then check to
        ensure that the Flags-RS bit in the most recently added FC
        Segment is not equal to 0.

   9.   If the UPDATE message was received from a neighbor that is
        expected to set Flags-RS bit to 0 (see Section 4), then check to
        ensure that the Flags-RS bit in the most recently added FC
        Segment is equal to 0.

   10.  If the UPDATE message was received from a neighbor that is not
        expected to set Flags-OTC bit to 1 (see Section 4), then check
        to ensure that the Flags-OTC bit in the most recently added FC
        Segment is not equal to 1.

   11.  If the UPDATE message was received from a neighbor that is
        expected to set Flags-OTC bit to 1 (see Section 4), then check
        to ensure that the Flags-OTC bit in the most recently added FC
        Segment is equal to 1.

   If any of the checks for the FC path attribute fail, indicating a
   syntactical or protocol error, it is considered an error.  In such
   cases, FC speakers are REQUIRED to handle these errors using the
   "treat-as-withdraw" approach as defined in [RFC7606].  This approach
   means that the FC-BGP speaker SHOULD treat the FC path attribute as
   if it were a withdraw message, effectively removing the route from
   consideration.  It's worth noting that when a transparent route
   server is involved, and its AS number appears in the FC (with the
   Flags-RS bit set to 1), the route server has the option to check if
   its local AS is listed in the FC.  This additional check can be
   included as part of the loop-detection mechanism mentioned earlier in
   the specification.

   When an AS appears on the AS_PATH of an UPDATE message and has
   uploaded router certificates in RPKI, it MUST add its FC segment to
   the FC path attribute.  Otherwise, the downstream ASes SHOULD
   consider that the FC of this AS has been removed by other ASes or the
   UPDATE message is falsified.

   When one FC Segment has set the Flags-OTC flag to 1, the subsequent
   FC Segments added by the following ASes MUST all set the Flags-OTC
   flag to 1 in their corresponding FC Segments.  The Flags-OTC flag is
   set to 1 only when the role of its neighbor, to whom the propagator
   AS sends routes, is Customer, Peer, or RS-Client.

   The following ingress procedure applies to the processing of the
   Flags-OTC flag on route receipt:

   1.  If a route, with the Flags-OTC flag in the recently added FC
       Segment, is received from a Customer or an RS-Client, then it is
       a route leak and MUST be considered ineligible.

   2.  If a route is received from a Peer (i.e., remote AS with a Peer
       Role) and with the Flags-OTC flag in both two recently
       consecutively added FC Segments, then it is a route leak and MUST
       be considered ineligible.

   Next, the FC-BGP speaker iterates through the FC segments.  Once the
   FC-BGP speaker has examined the signature field in the FC attribute,
   it proceeds to validate the signature using the supported algorithm
   suites.  However, if the FC-BGP speaker encounters a signature
   corresponding to an algorithm suite indexed by an Algorithm ID that
   it does not support, that particular signature is not considered in
   the validation process.  If there are no signatures corresponding to
   any algorithm suites supported by the FC-BGP speaker, a specific
   action is taken to ensure the continuity of the route selection
   process.  To consider the UPDATE message in the route selection
   process, the FC-BGP speaker has to treat the message as if it were
   received as an unsigned BGP UPDATE message.  By treating the UPDATE
   message as unsigned, the FC-BGP speaker acknowledges that it cannot
   verify the integrity and authenticity of the message through the
   provided signatures.  However, it still allows the message to be
   considered for route selection, ensuring that important routing
   information is not disregarded solely due to the lack of supported
   signature algorithms.

   For each remaining signature corresponding to an algorithm suite
   supported by the FC-BGP speaker, the FC-BGP speaker processes FC-BGP
   UPDATE message validation with the following steps.  As different FC
   segments are independent, it is recommended to verify FC segments
   parallelly.

   *  Step 1: Locate the public key needed to verify the signature in
      the current FC segment.  To do this, consult the valid RPKI router
      certificate data and look up all valid <AS Number, Public Key,
      Subject Key Identifier> triples in which the AS matches the
      Current AS Number (CASN) in the corresponding FC segment.  Of
      these triples that match the AS number, check whether there is an
      SKI that matches the value in the Subject Key Identifier field of
      the FC segment.  If this check finds no such matching SKI value,
      then mark the entire FC segment as 'Not Valid' and stop.

   *  Step 2: Compute the digest function (for the given algorithm
      suite) on the appropriate data.  To verify the digital signature
      in the FC segment, construct the sequence of octets to be hashed.
      Note that this sequence is the same sequence that was used by AS
      that created the FC Segment (see Section 4).  The elements in this
      sequence MUST be ordered exactly as shown in the generation
      process.  Note that if an FC-BGP speaker uses multiple AS Numbers
      (e.g., the FC-BGP speaker is a member of a confederation), the AS
      number used here MUST be the AS number announced in the OPEN
      message for the BGP session over which the FC-BGP UPDATE message
      was received.  All three AS numbers in one FC segment follow this
      rule.

   *  Step 3: Use the signature validation algorithm (for the given
      algorithm suite) to verify the signature in the current segment.
      That is, invoke the signature validation algorithm on the
      following three inputs: the value of the signature field in the
      current FC segment, the digest value computed in Step 2 above, and
      the public key obtained from the valid RPKI data in Step 1 above.
      If the signature validation algorithm determines that the
      signature is invalid, then mark the entire FC segment as 'Not
      Valid' and stop.  If the signature validation algorithm determines
      that the signature is valid, then the FC segment is marked as
      'Valid' and continues to process the following FC segments.

   If all FC segments are marked as 'Valid', then the validation
   algorithm terminates and the FC-BGP UPDATE message is deemed 'Valid'.
   Otherwise, the FC-BGP UPDATE message is deemed 'Not Valid'.

6.  Implementations, Operations, and Management Considerations

6.1.  Algorithms and Extensibility

   The content of Algorithm Suite Considerations defined in Section 6.1
   of [RFC8205] and content of Considerations for the SKI Size defined
   in Section 6.2 of [RFC8205] are indeed applicable in this context of
   FC-BGP.

   But the algorithm suite transition in FC-BGP is straightforward: As
   each FC segment has an Algorithm ID field, just populate this field
   with a feasible and consensus value that all FC-BGP speaker supports
   when transitioning.

6.2.  Speedup and Early Termination of Signature Verification

   It is advantageous for an implementation to establish a parallel
   verification process for FC-BGP if the router's processor supports
   such operations.  As each FC segment contains the integral data that
   needs to be verified, parallel verification can significantly enhance
   the efficiency and speed of the validation process.  By utilizing
   parallel processing capabilities, an implementation can
   simultaneously verify multiple FC segments, thereby reducing the
   overall verification time.  This is particularly beneficial in
   scenarios where the FC path attribute contains a substantial number
   of segments or in high-traffic networks with a large volume of FC-BGP
   UPDATE messages.  Implementations that leverage parallel verification
   take advantage of the processing power available in modern router
   processors.  This allows for more efficient and faster verification,
   ensuring that the FC-BGP UPDATE messages are promptly validated and
   routed accordingly.

   However, it's important to note that the feasibility of parallel
   verification depends on the specific capabilities and constraints of
   the router's processor.  Implementations SHOULD consider factors such
   as available resources, concurrency limitations, and the impact on
   overall system performance when implementing parallel verification
   processes.  Overall, setting up a parallel verification process for
   FC-BGP, if feasible, can contribute to improved performance and
   responsiveness in validating FC segments, further enhancing the
   reliability and efficiency of the FC-BGP protocol.

   During the validation of an FC-BGP UPDATE message, route processor
   performance speedup can be achieved by incorporating the following
   observations.  These observations provide valuable insights into
   optimizing the validation process and reducing the workload on the
   route processor.  One of the key observations is that an FC-BGP
   UPDATE message is considered 'Valid' only if all FC segments are
   marked as 'Valid' in the validation steps.  This means that if an FC
   segment is marked as 'Not Valid', there is no need to continue
   verifying the remaining unverified FC segments.  This optimization
   can significantly reduce the processing time and workload on the
   route processor.  Furthermore, when the FC-BGP UPDATE message is
   selected as the best path, the FC-BGP speaker appends its own FC
   segment, including the appropriate signature generated with the
   corresponding algorithm, to the FC path attribute.  This ensures that
   the updated path is propagated correctly.

   Additionally, an FC-BGP UPDATE message is considered as 'Not Valid'
   if at least one signature in each of the FC segments is invalid.
   Thus, the verification process for an FC segment can terminate early
   as soon as the first invalid signature is encountered.  There is no
   need to continue validating the remaining signatures in that FC
   segment.

   By incorporating these observations, an FC-BGP implementation can
   achieve significant performance improvements and reduce the
   computational burden on the route processor.  It allows for more
   efficient validation of FC-BGP UPDATE messages, ensuring the
   integrity and security of the routing information while maximizing
   system resources.

6.3.  Defering Validation

   When an FC-BGP speaker receives an exceptionally large number of
   UPDATE messages simultaneously, though it can use parallel
   verification to speed up the validation, it can be beneficial to
   defer the validation of incoming FC-BGP UPDATE messages.  The
   decision to defer the validation process may depend on the local
   policy of the FC-BGP speaker, taking into account factors such as
   available resources and system load.

   By deferring the validation of these messages, the FC-BGP speaker can
   prioritize its processing power and resources to handle other
   critical tasks or ongoing operations.  Deferring the validation
   allows the FC-BGP speaker to temporarily postpone the resource-
   intensive validation process until it can allocate sufficient
   resources to handle the influx of incoming messages effectively.

   The implementation SHOULD provide visibility to the operator
   regarding the deferment of validation and the status of the deferred
   messages.  This visibility enables the operator to have awareness of
   the deferred messages and understand the current state of the system.
   This information is crucial for monitoring and managing the FC-BGP
   speaker's behavior, ensuring that the operator can make informed
   decisions based on the system's status.

6.4.  BGP Route Selection

   While FC-BGP does modify the BGP route selection result, it is not
   the primary intention of FC-BGP to modify the BGP route selection
   process itself.  Instead, FC-BGP focuses on providing an additional
   layer of validation and verification for BGP UPDATE messages.

   However, the handling of FC-BGP validation states, as well as the
   integration of FC-BGP with the BGP route selection, is indeed a
   matter of local policy.  FC-BGP implementations SHOULD provide
   mechanisms that allow operators to define and configure their own
   local policies on a per-session basis.  This flexibility enables
   operators to customize the behavior of FC-BGP based on their specific
   requirements and preferences.

   By allowing operators to set local policies, FC-BGP implementations
   empower them to control how the validation status of FC-BGP UPDATE
   messages influences the BGP route selection process.  Operators may
   choose to treat FC-BGP validation status differently for UPDATE
   messages received over different BGP sessions, based on their
   network's needs and security considerations.

   To ensure consistency and interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED that
   FC-BGP implementations treat the priority of FC-BGP UPDATE messages
   at the same level as Route Origin Validation (ROV).  This means that
   the validation status of FC-BGP UPDATE messages should be considered
   alongside other route selection criteria, such as path attributes, AS
   path length, and local preference.

6.5.  Non-deterministic Signature Algorithms

   The non-deterministic nature of many signature algorithms can
   introduce variations in the signatures produced, even when signing
   the same data with the same key.  This means that if an FC-BGP router
   receives two FC-BGP UPDATE messages from the same peer, for the same
   prefix, with the same FC path attribute except the signature fields,
   the signature fields MAY differ when using a non-deterministic
   signature algorithm.  Note that if the sender caches and reuses the
   previous signature, the two sets of signature fields will not differ.
   This applies specifically to deterministic signature algorithms,
   where the signature fields between the two UPDATE messages MUST be
   identical.

   Considering these observations, an FC-BGP implementation MAY
   incorporate optimizations in the UPDATE validation processing.  These
   optimizations can take advantage of the non-deterministic nature of
   signature algorithms to reduce computational overhead.  For example,
   if an FC-BGP router has already validated an FC segment and its
   corresponding signature in a previous UPDATE message from the same
   peer, it may choose to cache and reuse the previous validation
   result.  This can help avoid redundant computations for subsequent
   UPDATE messages with the same FC path attribute and SKIs, as long as
   the sender does not generate new signatures.

   By incorporating such optimizations, an implementation can reduce the
   computational load and processing time needed for validating FC-BGP
   UPDATE messages.  However, it is important to ensure that the
   implementation adheres to the requirements and specifications of the
   FC-BGP protocol while considering the performance benefits of these
   optimizations.

6.6.  Private AS Numbers

   The process of Private AS Numbers used in BGPsec speaker defined in
   Section 7.5. of [RFC8205] also applies here.

6.7.  Robustness Considerations for Accessing RPKI Data

   As there is a mature RPKI to Router protocol [RFC8210], the
   implementation is REQUIRED to use this protocol to access the RPKI
   data.  The content defined in Section 7.6. of [RFC8205] also applies
   here.

6.8.  Graceful Restart

   During Graceful Restart (GR), restarting and receiving FC-BGP
   speakers MUST follow the procedures specified in [RFC4724] for
   restarting and receiving BGP speakers, respectively.  In particular,
   the behavior of retaining the forwarding state for the routes in the
   Loc-RIB [RFC4271] and marking them as stale, as well as not
   differentiating between stale routing information and other
   information during forwarding, will be the same as the behavior
   specified in [RFC4724].

6.9.  Robustness of Secret Random Number in ECDSA

   As both FC-BGP and BGPsec use ECDSA, the content of Robustness of
   Secret Random Number in ECDSA defined in Section 7.8. of [RFC8205]
   applies here.

6.10.  Incremental/Partial Deployment Considerations

   The core difference between FC-BGP and BGPsec is that BGPsec is a
   path-level authentication approach whereas FC-BGP is a pathlet-driven
   authentication approach.

   In design, FC-BGP does not modify the AS_PATH attribute.  It defines
   a new transitive path attribute to transport the FC segments so that
   the legacy ASes can forward this attribute to its peers.  Thus, FC-
   BGP is natively compatible with the BGP and supports partial
   deployment.  It differs from BGPsec which replaces the AS_PATH
   attribute with a new Secure_Path information of BGPsec_Path
   attribute.

   As for incremental/partial deployment considerations, in
   Section 5.1.1 of [FC-ARXIV], we have proved that the adversary cannot
   forge a valid AS path when FC-BGP is universally deployed.
   Section 5.1.2 of [FC-ARXIV] analyzes the benefits of FC-BGP in case
   of partial deployment.  The results show that FC-BGP provides more
   benefits than BGPsec in partial deployment.  As a result, attackers
   are forced to pretend to be at least two hops away from the
   destination AS, which reduces the probability of successful path
   hijacks.

6.11.  Co-existence with BGPsec

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED that both BGPsec and FC-BGP be enabled
   together.  However, at the very least, the implementation SHOULD
   adequately process the coexistence update message.

   When an FC-BGP speaker also enables the BGPsec feature, it MUST also
   properly process the BGPsec UPDATE message as follows:

   *  General Principle.  The BGP speaker SHOULD prioritize BGPsec over
      FC-BGP.  When both features are enabled, the BGP speaker processes
      the BGPsec UPDATE message first, then processes the FC-BGP UPDATE
      message.

   *  FC-BGP UPDATE Message Generation.  The BGP speaker SHOULD
      prioritize the BGPsec_Path attribute over the AS_PATH attribute.
      This means that when broadcasting a BGP UPDATE message, the BGP
      speaker SHOULD first check if the peer supports BGPsec.  If so, it
      SHOULD generate a BGPsec-enabled UPDATE message.  In this message,
      BGPsec_Path replaces the AS_PATH attribute, and an MP_REACH_NLRI
      attribute [RFC4760] is used for encoding NLRI information.  The
      generation of the FC Path attribute SHOULD use these attributes to
      generate FC Segments.  The impact on FC generation is minimal, as
      it only needs to obtain PASN, CASN, NASN, Prefix Address, and
      Prefix Length from BGPsec_Path and MP_REACH_NLRI attributes
      separately.

   *  FC-BGP UPDATE Message Validation.  The BGP speaker should also
      prioritize the BGPsec_Path over AS_PATH.  After processing the
      BGPsec path attribute, the BGP speaker should decode the
      BGPsec_Path and MP_REACH_NLRI attributes.  So, in the validation
      process, the BGP speaker SHOULD essentially reverse the steps it
      took during generation.  It would first decode the BGPsec_Path and
      MP_REACH_NLRI attributes to obtain the necessary information
      (PASN, CASN, NASN, Prefix Address, and Prefix Length).  Then, it
      would use this information to validate the corresponding FC
      Segment.

   In summary, the coexistence of BGPsec and FC-BGP is not overly
   burdensome.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Security Guarantees

   TBD.

   When FC-BGP is used in conjunction with origin validation, the
   following security guarantees can be achieved:

   *  The source AS in a route announcement is authorized.

   *  FC-BGP speakers on the AS-Path are authorized to propagate the
      route announcements.

   *  The forwarding path of packets is consistent with the routing path
      announced by the FC-BGP speakers.

   FC-BGP is designed to enhance the security of control plane routing
   in the Internet at the network layer.  Specifically, FC-BGP allows an
   AS to independently prove its BGP routing decisions with publicly
   verifiable cryptography commitments, based on which any on-path AS
   can verify the authenticity of a BGP path.  More crucially, the above
   security guarantees offered by FC-BGP are not binary, i.e., secure or
   non-secure.  Instead, the security benefits are strictly
   monotonically increasing as the deployment rate of FC-BGP (i.e., the
   percentage of ASs that are upgraded to support FC-BGP) increases.

7.2.  Mitigation of Denial-of-Service Attacks

   The FC-BGP UPDATE process, due to its involvement in numerous
   cryptographic operations, becomes vulnerable to Denial-of-Service
   (DoS) attacks targeting FC-BGP speakers.  This section addresses the
   mitigation strategies tailored for the specific DoS threats the FC-
   BGP protocol poses.  To prevent the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks
   faced by the FC-BGP control plane mechanism, there is no need to put
   in more effort than BGPsec.

   To reduce the impact of DoS attacks, FC-BGP speakers SHOULD employ an
   UPDATE validation algorithm that prioritizes inexpensive checks (such
   as syntax checks) before proceeding to more resource-intensive
   operations (like signature verification).  The validation algorithm
   described in Section 5.2.1 is designed to sequence checks in order of
   likely expense, starting with less costly operations.  However, the
   actual cost of executing these validation steps can vary across
   different implementations, and the algorithm in Section 5.2.1 may not
   offer the optimal level of DoS protection for all cases.

   Moreover, the transmission of UPDATE messages with the FC path
   attribute, which entails a multitude of signatures, is a potential
   vector for denial-of-service attacks.  To counter this,
   implementations of the validation algorithm must cease signature
   verification immediately upon encountering an invalid signature.
   This prevents prolonged sequences of invalid signatures from being
   exploited for DoS purposes.  Additionally, implementations can
   further mitigate such attacks by limiting validation efforts to only
   those UPDATE messages that, if found to be valid, would be chosen as
   the best path.  In other words, if an UPDATE message includes a route
   that would be disqualified by the best path selection process for
   some reason (such as an excessively long AS path), it is OPTIONALLY
   to determine its FC-BGP validity status.

7.3.  Route Server

   When the Route Server populates its FC Segment into the FC path
   attribute, it is secure as the path is fully deployed.

   When the Route Server fails to insert FC Segment, no matter whether
   its ASN is listed in the AS path, it is considered a partial
   deployment which poses a risk of path forgery.

7.4.  Additional Security Considerations

7.4.1.  Three AS Numbers

   An FC segment contains only partial path information and FCs in the
   FCList are independent.  To prevent BGP Path Splicing attacks, we
   propose to use the triplet <Previous AS Number, Current AS Number,
   Nexthop AS Number> to locate the pathlet information.

   But if there is no previous hop, i.e., this is the origin AS that
   tries to add its FC segment to the BGP UPDATE message, the Previous
   AS Number SHOULD be populated with 0.  But, carefully, AS 0 SHOULD
   only be used in this case.

   In the context of BGP [RFC4271], to detect an AS routing loop, it
   scans the full AS path (as specified in the AS_PATH attribute) and
   checks that the autonomous system number of the local system does not
   appear in the AS path.  As outlined in [RFC7607], Autonomous System 0
   was listed in the IANA Autonomous System Number Registry as "Reserved
   - May be used to identify non-routed networks".  So, there should be
   no AS 0 in the AS_PATH attribute of the BGP UPDATE message.
   Therefore, AS 0 could be used to populate the PASN field when no
   previous AS hops in the AS path.

7.4.2.  MISC

   For a discussion of the BGPsec threat model and related security
   considerations, please see [RFC7132].  The security considerations of
   [RFC4272] also apply to FC-BGP.

8.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.  Wait for IANA to assign FC-BGP-UPDATE-PATH-ATTRIBUTE-TYPE.

   TBD.  Regist Flags.  The leftmost bit is the Confed_Segment flag and
   the second highest/leftmost bit is the Route_Server flag in this
   document.

   TBD.  A new OID should be assigned for keys used in FC-BGP.

   AS number 0 is used here to populate the PASN in an FC segment where
   there is no previous hop for an AS, i.e., the origin AS when adding
   the FC segment to the FC-BGP UPDATE message.

   For basic comparison, please see Section 1.

A.1.1.1.  Deployment Benefits Analysis

   One of the core differences between FC-BGP and BGPsec is the partial
   deployment scenario.  It is difficult for FC-BGP and BGPsec to make
   an entire deployment, which is an evolution process.

   The propagation of the BGP UPDATE message can be simplified as a
   line.  Take the following propagation path as an example.

   AS(1) --- AS(2) -...- AS(k-1) ---- AS(k) -...- AS(n)
                                \               /
                                 \--- AS(m) ---/

             Figure 4: An BGP UPDATE propagation path example.

   In this propagation path, the settings are: - A path from AS(1) to
   AS(n) with N-1 hops, where FC-BGP is deployed consecutively from
   AS(1) to AS(k-1).  AS(k) is the first legacy AS that doesn't enable
   FC-BGP. - An upgraded AS(n) located after AS(k) tries to validate its
   received BGP path. - A compromised AS(m) intents to hijack the
   traffic from AS(n) to AS(1).

   Suppose the distance between AS(m), i.e., the compromised AS, and
   AS(n) is L hops.  The best choice for AS(m) is to pretend to be a
   neighbor of AS(k) and construct a fake path AS(1)-AS(2)-...-AS(k)-
   AS(m)-...-AS(n) with length K-1+1+L hops.  AS(m) can successfully
   hijack the traffic only if N-1>K-1+1+L, which implies that has to be
   smaller than N-L-1.

   In the full path deployment scenario, i.e., K=N+1, FC-BGP and BGPsec
   have the same path protection rate.  However, in the partial path
   deployment scenario, i.e., K<N-L-1, FC-BGP can protect more paths
   than BGPsec.

   So, the conclusion can be drawn that FC-BGP provides strictly more
   security benefits than BGPsec in partial/incremental deployment.

A.1.2.  ASPA

   The ASPA [ASPA-Profile] [ASPA-Verification] mechanism is designed to
   solve the problem of route leak with RPKI ASPA signed objects and
   AS_PATH attribute.  However, it does not protect the AS_PATH
   attribute.  Thus, ASPA and FC-BGP are complementary technologies.

A.1.3.  Only to Customer (OTC) Attribute

   OTC is a route-leak detection and prevention mechanism.  However, the
   OTC value itself is not protected.  It can be forged.  With the
   signature, FC-BGP can protect the Flags-OTC flag.  So the FC-BGP
   route leak prevention mechanism is complementary to the OTC
   attribute.

A.2.  Implementation Status

   We implement the FC-BGP mechanism with FRR version 9.0.1.  The
   implementation includes verifying the FC path attribute upon
   receiving BGP UPDATE messages and adding and signing the FC path
   attribute when sending BGP UPDATE messages.  The development and
   testing of this implementation were conducted on Ubuntu 22.04 with
   OpenSSL 3.X installed.
